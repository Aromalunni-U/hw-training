I did size down one size, per reviews, and the fit was perfect. For reference, I\'m 5\'6"" and 135 lbs and I ordered a size 4. I don\'t care for pockets in my dresses, but these don\'t add bulk, and they do lay flat. I purchased two colors, black and olive, and kept them both.

It keeps me cool and comfortable while traveling but looks sophisticated enough for any work function!"", 'This is the perfect lightweight, somewhat fitted dress for a daytime or evening event worn with pearls and heels, more casual on its own or styled with a jacket. You can soften the look with hoops and cool shoes. It has exactly the right amount of stretch to be comfortable. The pockets are big but lie flat. I have it now in black and wear as a shift. When I lose some weight, I will get it in black again as well as navy in a smaller size, and add a belt. etc. The ultimate go-to dress, especially for petites with a tummies. Love it.', 'I really like this dress but it might not be perfect enough to keep. First it‚Äôs just too short. Would be great to have 1-2 inches longer for my 5‚Äô9‚Äù frame. The dress does pool in the middle a bit (could be a little more defined in the waist). Also the size 2 is a bit big. There is no way that model is wearing a size 4. This is so disappointing since I ordered a size 4 and 2 but really need a zero. 133lbs, 32B.', ""I like this material and print compared to the other colors of the Maaza dress. I like the idea of a simple dress that can be worn for a variety of occasions and can be washed at home. I may try a size down (from 4 to 2) to see if that looks better, though it's still expensive for what it is and my QR code for happy returns did not work, so that was frustrating and I'm not sure I'll be able to exchange it for a different size. Still on the fence about this one, but seems more interesting than plain colors."", 'I like this dress on me much better with a belt.

Wish it was ~1"" longer for my 5\'6"" frame, but keeping it since the proportions are perfect with the jacket. Love the construction and full lining.', 'This is my third Maaza dress. This is the perfect dress for travel. It folds up to a small square and doesn‚Äôt wrinkle. I can dress it up with heels or down with sneakers or sandals.

I really wish I had purchased another in a different color!', 'The olive color is beautiful. The fabric is light, but formidable. The style is classic and the fit is comfortable, but professional.

Please make a petite version, or make the other origamitech dress come in black!', ""In LOVE with this dress! It is absolutely perfect for travel as it doesn't take up much space and steams quickly. The loose fit makes it so comfortable and the pockets are a bonus, especially since they lie so smoothly without creating bulk. I wear these dresses with the OrigamiTech Moreland jackets; mix and matching them. I adore that I can also wear the dress casually with sneakers, sandals and tall boots.

This is the only dress that fits me well with a great length (just above knee, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5‚Äù). Fabric feels great in Texas weather, but it creases a little more compared to the Black ones.

And the zipper has to be replaced because of the difficulty making it work."", 'The perfect dress! So easy, comfy, and polished. Bought my normal size.', ""I usually LOVE a shift dress and had high hopes for this one, but it was SO unflattering. When I walked out to show my husband, he asked if I had accidentally purchased a maternity dress.

I found sizing to be pretty accurate. It is fairly loose fitting, but not sloppy, and as another reviewer mentioned, I think it would be too tight in the hips if I sized down (but more slender, straight-figured women may want to do so, as I have a fairly athletic build, with wider shoulders and hips).

There‚Äôs room around the waist and hips without looking sloppy. Perfect fit around the chest and sleeves (I usually have a gaping hole around the front of the sleeves with similar cut dresses).

Its looser cut lets me feel comfortable while still being formal enough for work and social occasions (including the funeral for which I needed it).

I am petite (just over 5 feet), and the length is perfect. Also love the pockets.', ""This just might be THE dress! The fabric is a nice all-season weight, and the extended shoulder easily accommodates a jacket or cardigan in cooler weather. The silhouette is flattering and length is good for petites. I wear a 10 in some brands, but I usually size up to 12 for MM dresses and skirts. Given the cut of the Maaza (a shift, but a little bit shaped) that was the right call for me. And bonus points for pockets!

I even tried moving up a size, still not right on my body.', ""I was so sad that this dress didn't work for me, because I loved both the general cut (very flattering) and the blue color. But the fit was wrong for my body. The shoulder seams almost came to peaks on me, jutting away from my body. Even if I had steamed the dress, the seams would have come onto my upper biceps, creating a weird fit. The dress seemed cut for someone with broader shoulders. And, the pockets were incredibly unflattering and ruined the line of the dress. They were too shallow to be useful, and make the dress pouch around my lower abdomen. I love a dress with pockets but in this case the pockets were a mistake. I don't think sewing them closed would have helped the issue in my case as there still would have been some lumpiness in the fabric (and honestly I am not keen to do that type of alteration on a dress at this price point).

I exchanged it for a 16 and then I was swimming in the dress. It was so long on me that the pockets started below the hip line. It seems like the larger sizes are made for taller people.

The fit in the Brush Jacquard fabric is different than the regular Etsuko: it seems more fitted through the waist. It does strike me as a bit short, though; it hits me just above the knee, which is as short as I\'m willing to go, and since I\'m barely 5\'4"" on a good day it must be quite short on a taller person.', 'I wish it was about 1-2 inches longer. it is a bit short for me', 'I have the Etsuko in a solid color and I much prefer it to this one.

Beautiful details such as stitching and unique belt, and super flattering!', 'This dress fits just like it promises. Although the fabric is not stretchy, that actually fits the mood of the dress. Love the belt, and the knee length.']"

Maybe a few images of these clothes on normal sized women would be more reasonable!!', 'Elegant‚Ä¶great fabric‚Ä¶easy,to,wear..lovely lines', 'This dress is a lovely color! Unfortunately, the included belt is too wide for the ""belt loops"" and they instantly snapped off. They aren\'t really needed, as the belt stays in place on its own. The bodice is a little loose fitting, and puts too much of my decolletage on display (I do want to get ahead at work, but not like that!). This can be fixed, however, as I plan to have it altered to take 3 inches off the length and use the removed fabric to create a modesty panel. It\'s a great dress, though. The fabric feels really nice (if a bit heavy), the stitching is good and it looks like it would be easy to tailor. I would actually recommend that when buying pieces of this quality to size up, and then have the item tailored for a perfect fit.', 'Super flattering and a beautiful and unique color!', 'I love the Angel Dress in the Blue Jade color. It is the perfect dress for all sorts of occasions. I love the style, the length, and especially the fabric! I wish you would have a wool twill version of all of your dresses!

So unique and elegant yet casual enough for just about everything.The fabric is light yet feels sturdy for traveling. Material feels wrinkle resistant even though I haven‚Äôt tested the dress for work stress sweats, nor on the weekend yet for family runs, and all the squatting I do with a toddler around.Planning on wearing it soon but absolutely love the unique cut and style. The army green is a sophisticated deep algae green not a cheap camo green.So excited about this one truly. Please make more unique styles in midi length. Love pieces I can add to for an elevated look or keep as is for more casual events.I purchased size 10 and feel I might get away with downsizing to an 8. There‚Äôs about 1-2 inch stretch in the waist. But I like how comfortable it fits in a 10 and know I‚Äôll wear it much more for work & weekends if it has room to enjoy pasta and wine in. My measurements are 38 bust, 32 waist, 42 hips. I‚Äôm slightly more pear shaped than hourglass but because of my wide shoulders and thick arms this style fits like an hourglass; it skims the contour of the body beautifully. The tailoring is excellent. I‚Äôm 34G bra size and there‚Äôs no gaping in the top with this dress. A must have for busty gals.', 'Perfect fit and can be worn for work and lunch with friends', 'I LOVE THIS DRESS.

I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2‚Äù and didn‚Äôt feel the need to make any alterations. Love the cut through the upper body (just enough shoulder and v neck to be subtly sexy but appropriate in almost any setting) and the elastic gathering at the back that lends shape and ease. Blush color is lovely and fabric has just the right structure and lightness for warmer months. Stop debating and buy this now before it sells out!', 'It was very well made. Color was faded relative to the photo. However, the sizing was just too large for 0P and would require significant tailoring. I have most of my work clothes (suits and dresses, tops usually ok) tailored, but between the price point and faded color, I opted to return. I would repurchase MM Lafleur if near a store to try items on, but I would not purchase online again. I have had better luck purchasing workwear from other retailers online initialed J.C. & T and designer J.W. in terms of sizing and/or similarity of online images to item in real life.', 'I gave this dress five stars even though I didn\'t end up keeping it because I love all the OrigamiTech pieces so much. This dress was a little more formal looking than I needed right now, and I would have had to sew the back slit down a bit as it came up very high on me (I have a long torso). Honestly I wasn\'t sure why there was a back slit at all because the front provides room to walk... Anyway, I tried this dress in both my normal size 6 and a size 4. The 6 seemed a little roomy but I think that\'s the way it\'s supposed to fit. The 4 was too snug and the buttons gaped some. This dress would be amazing for a more formal office look, but I had to return which I found very quick and easy with MM\'s Happy Returns process!

It is flattering in every way, particularly because the material is a bit heavier and sturdier than expected (in a good way).', ""I loved this dress in the olive so I thought I'd love it in the blush. The color wasn't flattering to me so I returned it. I wear this dress a lot though!"", 'Would love to see this in all the colors of origamitech (and would absolutely love a navy origamitech material for all the pieces!). I\'ve worn it with the matching Moreland jacket and without, got compliments both ways. I\'m 5\'2"" and a 36DD and it fits me very well - and no hemming! I like to wear it with tall boots. The elastic in the back waist pulls it in ever so slightly to shape it to your waist without being tight. The arm holes fit properly and do not gape open to reveal a bra. The V-neck is not too revealing either. I have a work conference coming up with a presentation and I will be wearing this for sure! It washes easily in cold water and dries very quickly (overnight) on a hanger. I love love love the easy care of the origamitech line and it\'s my work wardrobe staple. Just wish the bags would come with the pieces like they used to.']"

The fabric is incredibly soft and silky, making it a delight to wear. Not only that, but it also fits true to size, hugging my contours in all the right places and enhancing my figure. It truly embodies the essence of French chic, adding an elegant and sophisticated touch to my wardrobe. I couldn't be happier with this purchase."", ""I LOVE the kaleidoscope print. Ultimately returned the dress because I wasn't quite sure the fabrication would have the longevity I want in a dress, but in a top (the Nora, for sure!), it would be great."", 'A lovely fabric, print, and design.
